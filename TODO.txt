Add draggable regions.
Add animating back to home.
Add detecting when you're dragging over another draggable. Or find another solution
to the rows and columns thing. Maybe subclassing and having some identifying trait
of a row or column?

Think about how you might want to subclass. How would you call a parent's event handler and then do your own logic, maybe? You can't override the event handler,
but you could override a method...then call that method in the event handler or something?







Resize divs to match the size of the card sprites.
